        <p>A companion and protector. The Fool doesn't seem to notice that he's on the edge of a cliff. The dog is like "hey, you need to watch where you're going" almost like a warning that the fool has no idea what's in store for him. It also seems somewhat playful, which emphasizes the Fool's innocence.</p>

        <h1><span>THE FOOL</span></h1>
        <p>The Fool is often seen as the most powerful card in the tarot deck. Representing new beginnings, spontaneity, and potential, The Fool  embodies the spirit of adventure and the willingness to step into the unknown. This card suggests a fresh start and encourages taking risks with optimism. It’s a reminder to embrace new opportunities with a sense of wonder and openness.</p>

      <div id="content4" class="content hidden">
        <p>What do you want to say to The Fool as you see him approach the edge of the cliff? Do you think he’s going to crash and burn or is this like one of those Instagram photos where the person hanging from the edge of the cliff is only 10cm from the ground? Maybe the height of the Fool’s cliff is just an illusion too.</p>
